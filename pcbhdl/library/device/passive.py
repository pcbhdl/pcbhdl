    ----------

    value : float
        Resistance, in ohms.

    tolerance : float
        Tolerance, in percents. Tolerance value of 10.0 corresponds to a Â±10% resistor.
        Cannot be specified together with ``series``.

    series : one of "E6", "E12", "E24", "E48", "E96"
        EIA "E" series, specifying the number of logarithmic steps per decade. If specified,
        ``value`` is rounded to the nearest value present in the series, and ``tolerance``
        is set to the value corresponding to the decade.

        The "E12" series is used by default.
